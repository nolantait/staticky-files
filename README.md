# Staticky files

This is a hard fork of `dry-files` that adds extensions for:

- `entries` to walk entries in a directory

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add staticky-files

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install staticky-files

## Usage

See the documentation for [`dry-files`](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-files)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`bin/rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
